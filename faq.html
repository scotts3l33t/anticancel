							<h2>FAQ</h2>
						</header>
						<h4>1. Why is this necessary?</h4>
						<p>It is immoral to destroy a person and their family because you can get enough of a mob together online 
							to scare a company into firing someone to avoid bad publicity or get a bank to drop someone because a 
							reporter is writing a hit piece about them.</p>
						<h4>2. Why do you care? Have you been canceled?</h4>
						<p>No I have not been canceled, and am unlikely to be (except potentially for doing this).</p>
						<p>I care because for years I have watched this get worse and worse. I watched conservatives try to cancel people (mainly celebrities) for standing against George W. Bush. I read stories about people being fired for being communists, even though they did not speak about this at work. I have watched as some have begun targeting people they disagree with and trying to find, dox, and go after them for no more reason then it makes them feel like they can hurt those who they disagree with. I didn’t like it when conservatives did it, I still don’t like it now. Companies fear cancellation too.</p>
						<h4>3. How is this actually going to help?</h4>
						<p>I feel like these steps as proposed in the text of the of the legislation will free people to engage and disagree and even face social consequences without winding up on public assistance, and will free social media to improve business without wasting ever more money on policing people for political ideas that they fear will set off the next storm of media condemnation. </p>
						<h4>4. How will this effect international companies and law?</h4>
						<p>International companies who do business in the US must abide by US law on interactions in the US. This law as drafted would only effect speech that is done by US citizens.</p>
						<h4>5. Is there other legislation like this being proposed?</h4>
						<p>I am not currently aware of any similar legislation, but will update this document when and if I become aware of it.</p>
						<h4>6. How would this effect Right to Work States?</h4>
						<p>Protected classes are not limited or infringed by Right to Work statutes. Employers are responsible to make sure that hiring and firing is done in a politically neutral way, just as they are responsible for ensuring that racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry are not influencing the employment decisions.</p>
						<h4>7. What should an employer do if contacted about the political beliefs of an employee or is threatened with a boycott?</h4>
						<p>Ideally, after this legislation is enacted, depending on the compliance regulations, the only acceptable 
							response from an employer in this case should be “I am not legally allowed to act on this knowledge and
							am not legally allowed to continue this conversation”</p>
