							<h2>Micheal Italie</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>Oct. 22, 2001</h3>
						<p>On Oct. 22, a sewing-machine operator named Michael Italie was fired by Goodwill Industries, the network of nonprofit
						groups best-known for collecting and selling used clothing and furniture in order to provide job training for the
						disabled. Among Goodwill’s lesser-known functions is to supply low-cost contract labor to the federal government.
						Italie’s job was to sew U.S. Navy jackets in Goodwill’s Miami plant.</p>
						<p>At 5 p.m., half an hour before the conclusion of his 10-and-a-half-hour shift, Italie’s supervisor called him into the
						personnel office, where he was greeted by the plant’s head of security. “Because of your views of the U.S. government,
						which are contrary to those of this agency, you are a disruptive force and cannot work here anymore,” he said, according
						to Italie. “Take your things and go.”</p>
						<p>Italie does indeed have a view of the U.S. government that is unconventional, even hostile: As a member of the Socialist
						Workers Party, he favors creation of a “workers’ and farmers’ government” in the United States along the lines
						envisioned by Karl Marx, V.I. Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. (The Socialist Workers Party began life in 1928 as a Trotskyist
						splinter from the Communist Party U.S.A., but over the past 30 years the venerable blood-feud between Leninists and
						Trotskyites has faded.) “We don’t advocate violence,” Italie told Chatterbox. “Violence is rooted in the capitalist
						system.”</p>
						<p>Italie had not been proselytizing within the Goodwill plant, and he was not accused of doing so. His views had come to
						management’s attention only because Italie was making a quixotic run for Miami mayor on the Socialist Workers Party
						ticket. A few days before his firing, Italie appeared in a TV debate and made several highly provocative remarks.
						Discussing the war on terrorism, he invited viewers to “join the fight to build a revolutionary working-class movement
						that can take power out of the hands of the warmakers.” Italie also spoke words that were guaranteed to enrage Miami
						voters: “I support the Cuban Revolution.”</p>
