							<h2>The Anti-Cancel Act</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>American National Tolerance Involving Citizen Activity in National Conversations and Ensuring Liberty Act</h3>
						<h4>The Purpose:</h4>
						<p>To ensure domestic security and the common welfare by protecting citizens involved in political discussion from
						arbitrary punishment, limitations, and\or termination by employers, financial institutions, and public platforms.</p>
						<h4>Proposed Actions:</h4>
						<p>1. Extend the definition of protected class to include political beliefs and discourse for hiring, firing, and advancement
						in employment. This includes the beliefs of a person's family member who the person may have no control over. This
						should not be construed to protect speech while speaking on behalf of the employer or on the employer's time. Employers
						can still put reasonable restrictions on speech to ensure a non-discriminatory, non-hostile work environment. People who
						are the “public face” of a business or have morality clauses are also not covered by this extension.</p>
						<p>2. Clarify that social media cannot be both a platform and a publisher, and that 230 protections are forfeit if the
						platform discriminates based on political beliefs with regards to accessing the platform. Platforms can still set
						reasonable restrictions on offensive speech that do not overly infringe on expressions of political belief (I.E. Banning
						of slurs and personal attacks is permissible).</p>
						<p>3. Banking and financial services are necessary for modern life, and because banking and financial institutions are
						protected, insured, and sanctioned by the US Government, it shall be illegal for financial institutions to use political
						affiliation or speech as a consideration to create or severe a relationship to a business or individual.</p>
						<p>Penalties for violation of this act shall be fines and sanctions as decided by the legislature, as well as being a cause
						for action in tort.</p>
